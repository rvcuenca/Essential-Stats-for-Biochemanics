Models were trained on an OpenSim-simulated dataset of 28 subjects (14 healthy, 14 knee OA) walking with recorded kinematics/kinetics. *Random forests* and *neural networks* achieved the highest accuracy in estimating medial and lateral contact forces.
    -   **Software:** MATLAB R2021b (Statistics and ML Toolbox) was used for all models and performance analyses.
    -   **Data:** *In-lab gait measurements* (3D motion capture + force plates) from 28 individuals; the authors provide their custom OpenSim knee model on SimTK for reproducibility. (Published in *Sci. Reports*, IF≈4.0)
2.  @Staunton2024_swimPCA– *PCA-based performance prediction in elite swimming*.

For each women’s short-course freestyle event (50 m to 800 m), start, turn, and free-swimming split times were PCA-reduced to key components (reducing multicollinearity). Then linear regressions predicted total race time from those PC scores, yielding a “Potential Performance Predictor” tool.
    -   **Software:** R or Python (for PCA and regression; not explicitly stated).
    -   **Data:** *European Championship race data* – official split times and velocities from all finalists in multiple events (public competition data). The model showed \<0.1 s bias between predicted vs. actual times, with strong agreement (e.g., ±0.6 s LoA on 100 m freestyle). (Published in *J. Sports Sciences*, IF≈3.5)
3.  @Lan2024_gaitDL– *Deep learning for diagnosing pediatric gait disorders*.
    -   **Methodologies:** Developed a *deep CNN classifier* to assist in clinical diagnosis of gait abnormalities in children. The model was trained on full 3D kinematic curves from gait lab exams, learning to distinguish conditions like cerebral palsy vs. toe-walking. Achieved “good-to-excellent” diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.77–0.99) in classifying healthy vs various pathologies.
    -   **Software:** TensorFlow/Keras.
    -   **Data:** *Clinical 3D gait analysis data* from a rehab hospital in France – hundreds of gait trials labeled by diagnosis (data not public). Notably, the study underscores the need for multi-center gait data standardization for AI. (Published in *Comput. Biology & Medicine*, IF≈4.6)
4.  @Rodu2024_MLframework– *On leveraging machine learning in sport science (within a hypothetico-deductive framework)*.
    -   **Methodologies:** A critical *conceptual analysis* contrasting ML’s pattern-finding approach with traditional hypothesis-driven statistics.

    -   **Software:** N/A (theoretical paper).
    -   **Data:** N/A – uses case studies (e.g., using a supervised ML model to explore a known hypothesis on training load) to illustrate points. Key takeaway: ML should be used with caution in sports biomechanics, serving exploratory analysis to generate hypotheses, analogous to avoiding p-hacking in stats. (Published in *Sports Med. – Open*, IF≈4.1)

    -   **Methodologies:** *State-of-the-art review* summarizing the past year’s advances in osteoarthritis biomechanics research. Notably, it highlights emerging use of *machine learning to augment gait analysis* for knee OA. For example, one cited study used ML to predict cartilage worsening from gait and activity data with high accuracy (referencing Costello *et al.* 2023 in BJSM). It also discusses traditional biomechanics findings (e.g., links between knee adduction moment and OA progression) and the continued importance of *`movement retraining`* interventions.
    -   **Software:** N/A.
    -   **Data:** N/A (review of \~50 papers from Mar 2022–Apr 2023). This comprehensive overview identifies gaps (e.g., need for personalized biomechanical interventions and larger datasets for ML). (Published in *Osteoarthritis & Cartilage*, IF≈6.9)

## 2025 – Top Emerging Studies and Preprints (Sports Biomechanics & Modeling)

1.  @Yamashita2025_fewshot– *Deep learning-based automatic keypoint tracking for sports biomechanics (few-shot approach)*.
    -   **Methodologies:** Introduces a *few-shot deep learning* method to track custom biomechanical keypoints on athletes from video. Using a pre-trained VGG16 CNN as a backbone, it trains a lightweight convolutional head on as few as \~10 manually annotated frames per video. By freezing the backbone and training on those few frames (transfer learning), the network can then accurately track the defined points throughout the video.
    -   **Software:** Custom TensorFlow/Keras implementation; integrated into an open-source tool.
    -   **Data:** Tested on *various sports videos* (e.g., baseball swings, tennis serves) – each video required only minimal manual annotation for training. This drastically reduces labor compared to frame-by-frame manual digitization, enabling fast, *sport-specific motion tracking* in the field. (Published in *MDPI Biomechanics*, IF≈N/A (new journal))
2.  @Qin2025_performanceML– *Predictive athlete performance modeling with ML and biometric integration*.
    -   **Methodologies:** Developed an *integrative ML framework* combining physiological, biomechanical, and psychological data to predict sports performance. A *gradient boosting machine* and a *neural network* were trained on 480 athletes’ data – inputs included heart rate variability, VO₂max, muscle activation patterns, as well as mental toughness and training load. The hybrid model achieved **R² ≈ 0.90** in predicting performance outcomes, outperforming simpler regression models (R² ≈ 0.77).
    -   **Software:** XGBoost and TensorFlow.
    -   **Data:** *Multimodal dataset of 480 athletes* across multiple sports (collected by the authors; not public). Key data sources were wearables (for HRV, acceleration), motion capture (for explosive power metrics), and questionnaires (for psychological scores). (Published in *Sci. Reports*, IF≈4.0)
3.  @Wang2025_SciData– *Dataset of walking and running biomechanics with varying step widths*.
    -   **Methodologies:** *Data descriptor paper* – provides a large open dataset and outlines its collection/validation. The dataset contains synchronized 3D kinematics and kinetics for human walking and running trials at different step widths and speeds. Extensive quality checks (e.g., comparability to published norms) are reported to ensure reliability.
    -   **Software:** Data processed with OpenSim 4.3; distributed in MATLAB and CSV formats.
    -   **Data:** *Comprehensive open dataset* (N≈30 subjects) walking and running at narrow, self-selected, and wide step widths across multiple speeds. This dataset (hosted on *Nature SciData*) fills a gap for training and testing gait analysis algorithms on varied gait patterns. (Published in *Scientific Data*, IF≈8.5)
4.  @Simos2025_KINESIS– *KINESIS: Reinforcement learning-based motion imitation for physiologically plausible musculoskeletal control*.
    -   **Methodologies:** A **model-free deep reinforcement learning** framework that teaches a physics-based musculoskeletal avatar to imitate human movements. KINESIS uses a detailed lower-body model (20 DOF, 80 muscle actuators) and learns to produce human-like gait and motions by training on motion-capture data with muscle actuator control signals as outputs. It achieved high accuracy in reproducing motions and even allows **natural language** commands to control the avatar via a text-to-motion model. Importantly, the muscle activation patterns from the policy correlated well with real EMG data, addressing the classic neuromuscular redundancy problem in biomechanics.
    -   **Software:** Custom RL code (PyTorch) interfacing with MuJoCo or OpenSim for simulation.
    -   **Data:** Trained on \~1.9 hours of motion-capture gait and locomotion clips (from public mocap datasets). Code and pretrained models are open-sourced on GitHub. (*Preprint on arXiv*, anticipated high impact in musculoskeletal modeling)
5.  @Horsak2025_VAEgait– *Unsupervised deep learning to identify individual “gait fingerprints” after stroke*.
    -   **Methodologies:** Proposed a **variational autoencoder (VAE)** approach to analyze high-dimensional 3D gait data without predefined features. The VAE learns a low-dimensional latent representation of each patient’s gait pattern, capturing unique individual-specific characteristics. In preliminary results, latent gait “clusters” emerged that distinguish post-stroke patients from healthy controls, and even differentiated sub-types of gait impairment. This suggests an objective way to quantify gait quality changes during rehabilitation.
    -   **Software:** PyTorch VAE implementation.
    -   **Data:** 3D gait lab data from \~50 stroke survivors and healthy controls (each with full joint kinematic time-series). While still a **preprint (medRxiv)**, this work is recognized as *field-shaping* for using unsupervised deep learning to guide rehabilitation decisions. (medRxiv preprint, 2024 Dec – under review)

**Note:** 2025 is ongoing – entries include influential **preprints** (e.g., Simos *et al.* and Horsak *et al.*) that are shaping the field despite not yet being in print. These studies illustrate emerging trends like combining reinforcement learning and biomechanics, and using unsupervised deep learning to capture personalized movement patterns. Each selected work comes from a journal (or preprint) with **IF \>3** or high anticipated impact, and collectively they balance **traditional stats methods** (regression, PCA, ANOVA, validation metrics) with **modern ML/DL approaches** (CNNs, ensemble ML, RL). The table also notes software/tools and data availability – notably, several works have shared **open datasets or code**, helping address data scarcity (a recurring gap identified in narrative reviews). Any gaps in subdomains are minor; for example, **sports biomechanics** is well-represented (e.g., markerless motion, performance analytics) and **rehabilitation biomechanics** is strongly covered (exoskeletons, gait pathology prediction). **Musculoskeletal modeling** advances appear via hybrid ML-model approaches and open resources. A remaining gap is the need for *larger, standardized datasets* (as flagged by Mundt *et al.*), but the community is clearly moving to address this through data papers and collaborative platforms.
