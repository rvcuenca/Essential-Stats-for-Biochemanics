## Historical Foundations (Pre-1960)

-   **Giovanni Borelli (De Motu Animalium,** [-@Borelli1680]**)**

    Borelli extended Galileo’s laws to living systems, performing the first quantitative analysis of muscle forces and joint mechanics. He showed that muscle forces must far exceed external loads due to leverage, laying the groundwork for modern analyses of force generation and transmission in the musculoskeletal system .

-   **Adolphe Quetelet (Essai de physique sociale,** [-@Quetelet1835]**)**

    Quetelet pioneered the use of statistics in human studies by defining the “average man” and conducting large-scale cross-sectional measurements. His work introduced the Quetelet Index (body mass/height²), now known as Body Mass Index (BMI), and established probability‐based social physics as a statistical discipline .

-   **Karl Pearson (Regression, Heredity, and Panmixia, [-@Pearson1896])**

    Pearson developed the product‐moment correlation coefficient to quantify relationships in biological data and, in 1901, co-founded *Biometrika*, the first journal dedicated to statistical study of biological variation. This institutionalized rigorous statistical methods in the study of anatomy and movement .

-   **Wilfrid Dempster (Space Requirements of the Seated Operator, [-@Dempster1955])**

    Based on cadaver dissections, Dempster derived regression equations for segment masses, centers of mass, and radii of gyration—especially for the seated posture. These empirical anthropometric parameters became the standard inputs for biomechanical body-segment models used throughout the latter half of the 20th century .

## Middle-Range Pivotal Studies (1961–2000)

-   **Ernest P. Hanavan** [-@Hanavan1964]\
    Introduced a comprehensive mathematical model of the human body by representing each body segment as a simple geometric solid (e.g., cylinders, ellipsoids) with associated mass and dimension parameters. His Air Force technical report enabled, for the first time, the computation of whole-body inertial properties directly from anthropometric measurements—laying the foundation for digital dynamical simulations in biomechanics by leveraging Dempster’s cadaver-derived segment densities .

-   **David A. Winter** [-@Winter1990]\
    Systematized experimental gait analysis through his landmark textbook *Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Movement*. Winter introduced standardized techniques for (1) normalizing stance-phase timing, (2) calculating joint moments and powers throughout the gait cycle, and (3) analyzing multi-joint coordination. These methods rapidly became the field’s gold standard for kinetic and kinematic gait studies, accelerating reproducibility and cross-study comparability .

-   **Nan M. Laird & James H. Ware** [-@LairdWare1982]\
    Developed the theory and application of random-effects (multilevel) models for longitudinal data in *Biometrics*. Their work provided a rigorous statistical framework to model within-subject correlations by specifying subject-level random intercepts and slopes—greatly enhancing power and generalizability over repeated-measures ANOVA in biomechanics experiments with multiple trials per participant .

-   **Kevin J. Deluzio et al.** [-@Deluzio1997]\
    Pioneered the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on full gait waveforms in *Human Movement Science*. By modeling entire knee-angle and moment curves rather than isolated peaks, they extracted the principal modes of variation that distinguish normal from pathological gait—demonstrating that PCA could reveal subtle, distributed differences that discrete measures alone would miss .

## Most Recent Pivotal Advances (2001-2025)

-   **Pataky et al.** [-@Pataky2013]\
    Introduced **vector-field Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)** for biomechanical signals, extending the one-dimensional SPM framework to multi-component trajectories (e.g. 3D kinematic and force curves). By applying Random Field Theory to entire movement waveforms, they provided a family‐wise‐error–controlled method for detecting when and where along a continuous trajectory groups differ—eliminating the need to preselect discrete time points or peaks .

-   **Warmenhoven et al.** [-@Warmenhoven2019]\
    Published a two-part tutorial series on **functional principal component analysis (fPCA)** in sports biomechanics. They demonstrated how to decompose complex motion curves—such as on-water rowing stroke force-time profiles—into orthogonal modes of variation, discussed critical preprocessing steps (temporal normalization, phase alignment), and provided guidance on interpreting PC loadings in biomechanical terms, thereby lowering the barrier to FDA adoption in the field .

-   **Johnson et al.** [-@Johnson2022]\
    Developed a **Bayesian inference** approach to the muscle-redundancy problem in musculoskeletal modeling. Rather than a single “best‐fit” solution, they sampled from the posterior distribution of muscle force trajectories consistent with measured kinematics and physiological priors, quantifying uncertainty in force estimates and showing how **hierarchical Bayesian models** can incorporate variability at multiple levels (e.g. subject, trial) .

-   **Xiang et al.** [-@Xiang2022]\
    Conducted a systematic review of machine-learning applications in lower-limb running biomechanics using wearable sensors. They found that 57% of recent studies employed **deep-learning architectures** (CNNs, RNNs) to predict joint kinematics and ground reaction forces, highlighted strong within-sample performance, and pointed out a critical need for more **rigorous external validation** and **cross-validation** practices to ensure model generalizability .

    Provided the first concise, field-focused synthesis of **Functional Data Analysis (FDA)** in biomechanics, systematically reviewing core techniques—such as functional principal component analysis, functional ANOVA, and functional regression—while highlighting best practices in preprocessing (e.g. temporal normalization, basis expansions), software implementations, and emerging areas (e.g. functional clustering, depth-based classification).

    Developed **region-of-interest (ROI) analyses** within the 1D-SPM framework to augment statistical power. Their PeerJ paper showed how defining anatomically or functionally meaningful ROIs (0D subregions) within a continuous signal (1D) bridges traditional peak-based tests and full-waveform analyses, providing practical algorithms for ROI selection, cluster-extent inference, and enhanced interpretability in gait and movement studies .

-   **Amrhein, Greenland & McShane [-@Amrhein2019]**\
    Critiqued the entrenched reliance on arbitrary $p<0.05$ thresholds in scientific research and formally called for retiring the term “statistical significance.” Appearing in *Nature*, this article championed reporting effect sizes with confidence intervals, contextual interpretation of $p$-values, and greater use of estimation and **Bayesian methods** to foster more transparent statistical inference across disciplines, including biomechanics .
